# Kindnet and Kube-Proxy Upstream Integration with MicroShift

## Overview

Kindnet is a simple CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin that provides basic
networking capabilities for Kubernetes clusters. It is lightweight and designed
for single-node or small cluster deployments.

Kube-proxy is the Kubernetes network proxy that runs on each node, maintaining
network rules and enabling Service abstraction by forwarding connections to pods.

[Kindnet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/tree/main/images/kindnetd) and
[Kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/)
are integrated with [MicroShift](https://github.com/openshift/microshift) downstream
by generating manifests from upstream configurations.

## Deployment

Run the `src/kindnet/generate_manifests.sh` script to generate both Kindnet and
Kube-proxy manifests.

This script will:
- Fetch the latest Kindnet image from Docker Hub (`docker.io/kindest/kindnetd`)
- Fetch the latest Kube-proxy image from the official Kubernetes registry (`registry.k8s.io/kube-proxy`)
- Generate namespace, RBAC, and DaemonSet manifests for Kindnet
- Generate namespace, RBAC, ConfigMap, and DaemonSet manifests for Kube-proxy
- Generate kustomization files with architecture-specific image references
- Generate release JSON files with the resolved image digests

```

## Pod Network

Kindnet and Kube-proxy have to agree with MicroShift's `network.clusterNetwork`
setting, which defaults to `10.42.0.0/16`.

- **Kindnet** reads its pod subnet from the `podSubnet` key of the
  `kindnet-config` ConfigMap in the `kube-kindnet` namespace. Kindnet masquerades
  traffic to every destination outside this range. If the value does not match
  the cluster network, connections into pods are masqueraded as well, and pods
  such as the router see the node's address on the pod network instead of the
  client address.
- **Kube-proxy** needs no CIDR. It recognises pod traffic by the node's
  `spec.podCIDRs` (`detectLocalMode: NodeCIDR`), which MicroShift allocates from
  `clusterNetwork`.

### Using a Different Cluster Network

The packaged `kindnet-config` ConfigMap carries the default. For a cluster with
a different `network.clusterNetwork`, set `podSubnet` to the same value; for a
dual-stack cluster, separate both CIDRs with a comma.

Do not add a second `kindnet-config` ConfigMap somewhere in
`manifests.kustomizePaths`. MicroShift applies the kustomization paths one after
another on every start, so the packaged manifest resets `podSubnet` to the
default before the override is applied again. A kindnet pod that starts in
between, typically after a reboot, keeps the default and masquerades traffic
into the pods. The value has to be written in one place only:

- **Image mode (bootc) or container:** replace
  `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/000-microshift-kindnet/00-kindnet-config.yaml`
  in a derived image, or bind-mount a replacement file.
- **Package installation:** take the packaged kindnet kustomization out of
  `manifests.kustomizePaths` and apply it through an overlay that patches only
  the pod subnet, as shown below.

`/etc/microshift/config.d/10-kindnet-pod-subnet.yaml`:

```yaml
network:
  clusterNetwork:
    - 10.100.0.0/16
manifests:
  kustomizePaths:
    - /usr/lib/microshift/manifests
    # Every packaged directory except 000-microshift-kindnet, one by one.
    # See the first caveat below.
    - /usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/000-microshift-kube-proxy
    - /etc/microshift/manifests
    - /etc/microshift/manifests.d/*
```

`/etc/microshift/manifests.d/010-kindnet-pod-subnet/kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  # kustomize does not accept an absolute path here
  - ../../../../usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/000-microshift-kindnet
patches:
  - patch: |-
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: kindnet-config
        namespace: kube-kindnet
      data:
        podSubnet: 10.100.0.0/16
```

The overlay builds on the installed package, so updates of the kindnetd image
or the DaemonSet are picked up without touching it. If a future package renames
the ConfigMap or its key, the patch fails and MicroShift logs the failed
kustomization instead of applying a wrong value.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Caveats of the package installation variant**
>
> - **Packages installed later are not applied.** The glob
>   `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/*` cannot exclude a single directory, so
>   the list names every packaged directory explicitly. A package installed
>   later, for example `microshift-topolvm`, `microshift-olm` or
>   `microshift-gateway-api`, places its manifests in
>   `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d`, but MicroShift does not apply them
>   until the directory is added to the list. Nothing reports this. After
>   installing or removing packages, compare
>   `ls /usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d` with the list in
>   `microshift show-config`.
> - **A changed value needs a restart of kindnet.** kindnetd reads the value
>   only when it starts, and the DaemonSet itself does not change. After
>   switching an existing cluster to the overlay, or changing the value later,
>   run `oc rollout restart daemonset/kube-kindnet-ds -n kube-kindnet`.
> - **The relative path depends on where the overlay lives.** From
>   `/etc/microshift/manifests.d/<name>/` it takes four `../`.
> - **Delete manifests follow the list.** MicroShift looks for delete
>   manifests next to each kustomization path: in
>   `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/delete/*` for the glob, but in
>   `<directory>/delete` for a directory that is listed explicitly.
> - **Multi-node clusters:** keep the drop-in and the overlay identical on all
>   nodes, so that no node applies a different value.

To check the value kindnet actually uses:

```bash
oc get configmap kindnet-config -n kube-kindnet -o jsonpath='{.data.podSubnet}'
sudo iptables -t nat -S KIND-MASQ-AGENT   # expects a RETURN rule for the pod subnet
```

## Updating Image References

The script automatically fetches the latest images from upstream:
- **Kindnet**: Fetches the latest tag from Docker Hub (`docker.io/kindest/kindnetd`)
- **Kube-proxy**: Fetches the latest stable tag from the official Kubernetes registry (`registry.k8s.io/kube-proxy`), excluding alpha, beta, and rc versions

To update to a new version, simply re-run the generation script.

Image digests are stored in release JSON files after generation:
- `src/kindnet/assets/kindnet/release-kindnet-{aarch64,x86_64}.json`
- `src/kindnet/assets/kube-proxy/release-kube-proxy-{aarch64,x86_64}.json`

## Integrating with MicroShift RPMs

The `make rpm` command of the upstream repository first builds the original
MicroShift RPM files. In the second pass, the command copies the Kindnet and
Kube-proxy assets into the downstream directory structure. The command then uses
the downstream RPM build facilities to generate the RPM files.

The RPM files are built using the following command:

```bash
cd ~/microshift
MICROSHIFT_VARIANT=community make rpm
```
